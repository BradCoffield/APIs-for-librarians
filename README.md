# APIs-for-libarians
Building a group of API implementations from various providers to hopefully help librarians (and anyone else!). Intended for those that aren't coders but also those who just want to save a little time.

Visit https://www.apis4librarians.com/ for copy/pasteable code with instructions for use.

Please reach me at www.bradcoffield.com with any comments, questions, or concerns. 

If you end up finding this useful, I'd love to know!
